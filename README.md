# measuretool

This is the README accompanying measuretool.m.
measuretool.m is a matlab function that contains a GUI (Graphical User Interface).
Since it is a matlab function it requires matlab, and due to heavy use of the graphics 
features introduced with 2014b, this tool requires at least 2014b.

The tool has been hosted on the Matlab FileExchange since November 2009, 
the corresponding website can be found here:
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25964-image-measurement-utility

The current version (2.00) is not yet uploaded to the file exchange, since it is
currently in BETA state, and requires testing before it can be uploaded.

The GUI is reasonably self contained, and all code resides in one file: measuretool.m
This file also contains the GUI help, which is available through the GUI itself. See the header of measuretool.m for more info.
